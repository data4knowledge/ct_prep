Angiographic confirmation is the presence of a thrombus at coronary angiography that originates in the stent or in the segment 5 mm proximal or distal to the stent, with the presence of at least 1 of 3 clinical criteria within a 48-hour time window: 1) acute onset of ischemic symptoms at rest; 2) new ischemic ECG changes that suggest acute ischemia; or 3) typical rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers. Pathological confirmation is evidence of recent thrombus within the stent determined at autopsy or via examination of tissue retrieved following thrombectomy.
